This application can be started by running the main method of the TicTacToe class.

The algorithm for calculating moves is the minimax search algorithm adapted from 
https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/java/javagame_tictactoe_ai.html#zz-1.5
The first argument of the minimax method sets the depth of the search algorithm. 

The front end is implemented using Swing/AWT and is not sophisticated.
